                <p>Real Madrid Club de Fútbol (Spanish pronunciation: real madɾid kluβ ðe fuðβol], meaning Royal Madrid Football Club, commonly referred to as Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid who have been playing in La Liga since 1929.

                    Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid since 1947 and Real Madrid is also the most successful team in the FIFA Club World Cup, having been crowned winners 5 times since the tournament first started in 2000. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. The club is one of the most widely supported in the world,[6] and was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's most valuable football team.[7] In 2021, it was the second highest-earning football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €640.7 million.[8]</p>
