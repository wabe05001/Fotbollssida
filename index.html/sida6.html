                <p>Ligue 1,[A] officially known as Ligue 1 Uber Eats for sponsorship reasons,[1][2] is a French professional league for men's association football clubs. At top of the French football league system, it is the country's primary football competition. Administrated by the Ligue de Football Professionnel, Ligue 1 is contested by 20 clubs (as of the 22/23 season) and operates on a system of promotion and relegation from and to Ligue 2. In the 23/24 season, the teams are going to be changed from 20 to 18 teams. 4 teams in Ligue 1 will be relegated to Ligue 2 and two teams in Ligue 2 will be promoted to Ligue 1, which starts the 18 team change.</p>

                <p>Paris Saint-Germain Football Club was founded in August 1970 after the merger of Paris Football Club and Stade Saint-Germain. PSG made an immediate impact, winning promotion to Division 1 and claiming the Division 2 title in their first season. Their momentum was soon checked, however, and the club split in 1972. Paris FC remained in the top flight, while PSG were administratively relegated to Division 3. Following back-to-back promotions, PSG quickly returned to the premier division in 1974 and moved into the Parc des Princes.
                    The club's first trophies arrived in the 1980s. Steered by players such as Safet Sušić, Luis Fernandez and Dominique Rocheteau, the Parisians claimed two consecutive French Cup titles in 1982 and 1983 followed by their maiden league championship in 1986, after which they went into decline. But a takeover by television giants Canal+ in 1991 revitalised PSG. Led by David Ginola, George Weah and Raí, the club won nine trophies and reached five consecutive European semi-finals during the 1990s. Most notably, Paris claimed a second league title in 1994 and its crowning glory, the UEFA Cup Winners' Cup in 1996 with legend Luis Fernandez now as coach. </p>

                <p>Kylian Mbappé Lottin (born 20 December 1998) is a French professional footballer who plays as a forward for Ligue 1 club Paris Saint-Germain and captains the France national team. Regarded as one of the best players in the world, he is renowned for his dribbling abilities, exceptional speed, and finishing.[2][3]

                    Born in Paris and raised in nearby Bondy, Mbappé began his senior club career in 2015 playing for Monaco, where he won the Ligue 1 title. In 2017, aged 18, Mbappé signed for Paris Saint-Germain on an eventual permanent transfer worth €180 million, making him the second-most-expensive player and most expensive teenage player of all time.[4] There, he won four Ligue 1 titles and three Coupes de France, including a domestic quadruple in the 2019–20 season, as well as leading the club to its first ever UEFA Champions League Final in 2020. He is the club's all-time top goalscorer and third all-time in assists.</p>
